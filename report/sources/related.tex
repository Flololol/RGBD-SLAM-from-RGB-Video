    \begin{itemize}
        \item Learning the Depths of Moving People by Watching Frozen People (basis for consistent depth)
        \item consistent depth (they produce depth from monocular vision but don't use it for reconstructions)
        \item bundlefusion (rgb-d to 3d reconstruction (they focus on perfecting extrinsics i think))
        \item Monocular Depth Estimation Based On Deep
        Learning: An Overview (is this relevant to us?)
