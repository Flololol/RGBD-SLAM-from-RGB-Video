\chapter{Conclusion}
    conclusion may be, that the optimization just requires all the things we skipped.. better solver, better jacobian, better outlier filtering, ..\\
    or that the depth is just a bit fucked and the optimization approach actually works with the ground truth depth
    \begin{itemize}
        \item option1: blame everything on shitty depth (arguing, that the optimizer did the best he could) [I VOTE FOR THIS OPTION]
        \item option2: possibly present magical scale fix [I DONT SEE HOW THIS OPTION COULD STILL BE RELEVANT]
        \item option3: depth is not at fault and our optimization is just sadly not working as we want it to [THIS IS PROBABLY KINDA TRUE]
    \end{itemize}
    we probably end up with a combination of option 1 and 3\\
    maybe we should point out, that we may have underestimated the effort required for this project? (or not.. idk)\\
    what we sadly did not have enough time for, was to attempt the extrinsics refinement with the true depth and normals that are based on the true depth. this would show us if the optimization in itself works or not. the current results point to the refinement making the extrinsics worse. but that could very well be because of the broken depth that is used in the refinement process!\\
