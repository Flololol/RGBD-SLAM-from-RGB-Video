\chapter{Method}
    \section{Consistent Depth}
        this gives us depth and colmap extrinsics.\\
        talk about problems during consistent depth (holes in video) and potentially our attempts at fixing them.
    \section{Pose Optimization}
        include vis\_reprojection here to explain formulas.
    \section{3D Reconstruction}
        we tried out different approaches for the reconstruction and ended up using open3d\\
        talk about adjusting the extrinsics\\
        maybe talk about integration and deintegration (used by bundle fusion it is live and they update their reconstruction)
