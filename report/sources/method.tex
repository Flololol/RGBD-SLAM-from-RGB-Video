\chapter{Method}
    \section{Consistent Depth}
        this gives us depth and colmap extrinsics.\\
        talk about problems during consistent depth (holes in video) and potentially our attempts at fixing them.\\
        main point here is, that we get a depth estimate and extrinsics estimate!
    \section{3D Reconstruction}
        my reason to skip pose estimation for now is, that it is a bit of a story.\\
        1 get depth \& extrinsics\\
        2 use them\\
        3 improve on extrinsics.\\
        we tried out different approaches for the reconstruction and ended up using open3d\\
        talk about modifying the extrinsics to make everything work\\
        maybe talk about integration and deintegration (used by bundle fusion as it is live and they update their reconstruction)\\
        to improve on the shitty reconstruction we wanted to optimize the extrinsics. this would nicely lead into the next section!!!\\
        compare extrinsics to ground truth with the matlab 3d plot?
    \section{Pose Optimization}
        describe our method that is basically bundlefusion without a bunch of parts.. for some we can argue that we don't need it since we don't wanna run shit live.\\
        include vis\_reprojection here to explain represent what the energies in the optimization imply/mean.\\
        compare the bundlefusion custom cuda implementation to our scipy solver..
