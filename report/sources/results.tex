\chapter{Results}
    \section{pose optimization}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item show initial reconstruction without optimization (kinda shitty)
            \item explain that for optimization reasons we now have to only look at a subset of frames (kinda like they keyframes in bundlefusion)
            \item show initial reconstruction without and with optimization (both strided)
            \item compare and TRY to show, that it improved it in some way
            \item question if there even is a better set of extrinsics to combine the frames
        \end{itemize}
    \section{Consistent Depth}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item analyze quality of the depth estimation through the ground truth video
            \item show the depth error heatmap for the ground truth data!
            \item option1: blame everything on shitty depth (arguing, that the optimizer did the best he could)
            \item option2: possibly present magical scale fix
            \item option3: depth is not at fault and our optimization is just sadly not working as we want it to
        \end{itemize}
